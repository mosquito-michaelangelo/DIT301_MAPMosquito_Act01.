## What challenges did you face installing Android Studio?
The challenge I faced when installing Android Studio was that it took a really long time to install on my laptop.
When I finally opened it, my whole device started to lag and run slowly. I also had a problem when trying to run 
the app I made because it kept showing an error and wouldn’t open properly.


## What did you learn about the Android app Structure?
I learned that Android Studio is like another coding app, but it’s easier to use because you can drag and drop 
elements to design the UI. However, it needs a high-end device to run smoothly since it can lag on slower laptops.
I also learned that Android Studio automatically creates the folders and files needed for a project, so you don’t
have to start everything from scratch. All you need to do is focus on coding and building your app.
